# About

This repository includes code from research under Antonella Palmese and Tom√°s Cabrera at Carnegie Mellon University starting in February 2025.
All scripts are made by Max Chandar-Kouba, research undergraduate in Physics.

Most work was analysis or not highly involved in the deeper cosmology. Nonetheless, the overarching work concerns Binary Black Hole (BBH) mergers being multimessenger events.
